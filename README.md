# 🕰️ GitHub Time Capsule

### *Send a Message to Your Future Self*

![Unlock Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unlock%20Date-January%201%2C%202035-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=calendar)

**Write today. Read in 2035. No technical knowledge required.**

---

</div>

## 🎯 What Is This?

**The GitHub Time Capsule** is like sending a letter to yourself 10 years into the future!

Write a message today, and GitHub will **automatically lock it**. On **January 1, 2035**, your message (and thousands of others) will **automatically unlock** for everyone to read!

### How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐
│  You Write   │ →  │    GitHub     │ →  │  Wait 10     │ →  │  Auto-Unlock   │
│  a Message   │    │  Locks It     │    │  Years⏰     │    │  in 2035!🎉    │
└──────────────┘    └───────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └────────────────┘
```

1. ✍️ **You write** - A message about anything you want
2. 🔒 **GitHub locks it** - Strong security, nobody can read it
3. ⏰ **Everyone waits** - 10 years pass...
4. 🎉 **Auto-unlock in 2035** - All messages open at once!

> 💡 **Don't worry!** You don't need to know anything about coding. Just follow these simple steps!
