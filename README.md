## 🎯 What is This?

**The GitHub Time Capsule** is a digital time capsule where you can write a message to your future self or the world. Your message will be:

- 🔒 **Encrypted** (locked with strong security)
- 📦 **Sealed** (hidden from everyone, including you)
- ⏰ **Unlocked automatically on January 1, 2035** (10 years from now)

Think of it as **sending a letter to the future** — except it's done automatically, securely, and publicly on GitHub!

---

## ✨ How It Works (Simple Version)

```
You Write → GitHub Encrypts → Everyone Waits → Auto-Unlock in 2035 🎉
```

1. **You write a message** (about your life, dreams, predictions, anything!)
2. **GitHub automatically encrypts it** (turns it into secret code)
3. **Everyone waits 10 years** (the message is locked)
4. **January 1, 2035: All messages unlock automatically!** (you can read them all)

**No technical knowledge required!** Just write and submit. GitHub does the rest.

## 🔓 The Big Reveal: January 1, 2035

On **January 1, 2035 at midnight (UTC)**, GitHub will **automatically**:

- 🔓 Decrypt ALL messages at once
- 📂 Publish them in the `decrypted-messages` folder
- 🎉 Create a special announcement
- 🔑 Release the decryption key publicly

**You don't need to do anything!** Just come back on January 1, 2035 and read:
- Your own message from 10 years ago
- Messages from thousands of other people
- Predictions about the future (were they right?)

Imagine reading your 2025 thoughts in 2035! 🤯

## ❓ Questions You Might Have

<details>
<summary><b>Is this really secure?</b></summary>

Yes! We use **AES-256-GCM encryption** (military-grade security). Once your message is encrypted, no one can read it until the key is released in 2035.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I read my message before 2035?</b></summary>

The encrypted version in this repository? **No, it's locked.** But you can keep a copy in your own fork if you want!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if I make a mistake?</b></summary>

You can edit your file in your fork before creating the pull request. Once the pull request is created and processed, it's sealed!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I send more than one message?</b></summary>

Only your first message will be sealed. This preserves the authenticity of your original timestamp.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is my message private?</b></summary>

Your **encrypted message** is public (but unreadable). Your **original message** stays in your fork and the closed pull request. On January 1, 2035, all messages will be publicly decrypted.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if GitHub doesn't exist in 2035?</b></summary>

The repository is backed up and the decryption keys are stored securely. The unveiling will happen even if GitHub changes!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need to know coding?</b></summary>

**No!** This guide is designed for non-technical people. Just follow the 4 steps above — copy, paste, click!
