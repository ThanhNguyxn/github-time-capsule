**Write today. Read in 2035. No technical knowledge required.**

</div>

## 🎯 What Is This?

**The GitHub Time Capsule** is like sending a letter to yourself 10 years into the future!

Write a message today, and GitHub will **automatically lock it**. On **January 1, 2035**, your message (and thousands of others) will **automatically unlock** for everyone to read!

### How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐
│  You Write   │ → │    GitHub     │ → │  Wait 10     │ → │  Auto-Unlock   │
│  a Message   │    │  Locks It     │    │  Years ⏰    │    │  in 2035! 🎉  │
└──────────────┘    └───────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └────────────────┘
```

1. ✍️ **You write** - A message about anything you want
2. 🔒 **GitHub locks it** - Strong security, nobody can read it
3. ⏰ **Everyone waits** - 10 years pass...
4. 🎉 **Auto-unlock in 2035** - All messages open at once!

> 💡 **Don't worry!** You don't need to know anything about coding. Just follow these simple steps!

## ❓ Common Questions

<details>
<summary><b>🔒 Is my message safe?</b></summary>

Yes! We use military-grade security (AES-256 encryption). Once locked, it's mathematically impossible to unlock until 2035.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👀 Can I read it before 2035?</b></summary>

No, the locked version is unreadable. But you can keep a copy in your own folder if you want!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>❌ What if I make a mistake?</b></summary>

You can edit before clicking "Create pull request". After that (30 seconds), it's locked forever!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📝 Can I send multiple messages?</b></summary>

Only your first message will be locked. This keeps it authentic and special!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔓 Is my message private?</b></summary>

**Now:** The locked version is public but unreadable (it's gibberish).  
**2035:** Everyone can read all messages!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💻 Do I need to know coding?</b></summary>

**No!** This is for everyone. Just follow the 4 steps - it's just clicking buttons!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🆓 Is this free?</b></summary>

**Yes!** 100% free. No cost, no ads, no catch. It's a community project!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌍 Can I write in my language?</b></summary>

**Yes!** Any language works - English, Spanish, Chinese, emoji... whatever you want!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🗑️ Can I delete my message?</b></summary>

Only before it gets locked (within 30 seconds). After that, it's part of history!

</details>
