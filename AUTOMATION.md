# 🤖 Full Automation Documentation

## Overview

The GitHub Time Capsule is **100% automated** from start to finish. No human intervention is required for either the sealing or unveiling process.

---

## 🔐 Phase 1: Sealing (2025-2034) - AUTOMATIC

### Trigger
- User submits a Pull Request with their message file

### Process (Automatic)
1. **GitHub Action activates** (`seal-the-capsule.yml`)
2. **Validates** the message file exists and is properly formatted
3. **Encrypts** the message using GPG with public key
4. **Commits** encrypted file to `sealed/` directory
5. **Comments** on PR with confirmation
6. **Closes** PR without merging (keeps original private)

### Duration
- Typically completes in **30-60 seconds**

### User Actions Required
- ❌ **NONE** - Completely automatic after PR submission

---

## 🎆 Phase 2: Unveiling (January 1, 2035) - AUTOMATIC

### Trigger
- **Scheduled**: GitHub Actions cron job runs at `00:00 UTC on January 1, 2035`
- **Backup**: Manual workflow_dispatch trigger (in case scheduled run fails)

### Process (Automatic)
1. **Verifies date** is January 1, 2035 or later
2. **Imports private key** from GitHub Secret (`GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`)
3. **Decrypts all messages** using private key and passphrase
4. **Creates decrypted-messages/** directory with all messages
5. **Generates INDEX.md** with list of all messages
6. **Publishes private key** as `DECRYPTION-KEY.asc`
7. **Creates DECRYPTION-INSTRUCTIONS.md** with usage guide
8. **Updates README.md** with unveiling announcement
9. **Commits and pushes** all changes to main branch
10. **Creates GitHub Release** with decrypted messages attached
11. **Creates announcement issue** to notify community
12. **Posts completion status**

### Duration
- Typically completes in **3-5 minutes** (depending on number of messages)

### User Actions Required
- ❌ **NONE** - Completely automatic on schedule

## 🔑 Required GitHub Secrets

For the automation to work, you must set up these secrets:

### 1. `GPG_PUBLIC_KEY`
- **Used in**: Sealing process
- **Purpose**: Encrypt messages
- **Format**: ASCII-armored public key
- **Setup**: See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
- **Security**: Safe to be public

### 2. `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`
- **Used in**: Unveiling process
- **Purpose**: Decrypt messages on Jan 1, 2035
- **Format**: ASCII-armored private key
- **Setup**: See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
- **Security**: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Must be kept secret until unveiling

### 3. `GPG_PASSPHRASE`
- **Used in**: Unveiling process
- **Purpose**: Unlock the private key for decryption
- **Format**: Plain text passphrase
- **Setup**: See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
- **Security**: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Must be kept secret until unveiling

## 🔄 Workflow Details

### Sealing Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/seal-the-capsule.yml`

**Triggers**:
- `pull_request` event with type `opened`

**Steps**:
1. Checkout PR branch
2. Find message file
3. Verify content
4. Setup GPG
5. Encrypt message
6. Checkout main
7. Commit encrypted file
8. Update stats
9. Close PR with comment

**Permissions**:
- `contents: write` - To commit encrypted files
- `pull-requests: write` - To close PRs and comment

### Unveiling Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/auto-unveiling.yml`

**Triggers**:
- `schedule`: `0 0 1 1 2035` (Jan 1, 2035 at 00:00 UTC)
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger with confirmation

**Steps**:
1. Display unveiling banner
2. Verify current date
3. Checkout repository
4. Setup GPG
5. Import private key
6. Count sealed messages
7. Decrypt all messages
8. Create index file
9. Publish decryption key
10. Update README
11. Commit all changes
12. Create GitHub Release
13. Create announcement issue
14. Display completion message

**Permissions**:
- `contents: write` - To commit decrypted files
- `issues: write` - To create announcement
- `pull-requests: write` - For discussions

## 🚨 Backup Plan: Manual Trigger

If the scheduled workflow fails (GitHub Actions issues, etc.), maintainers can manually trigger the unveiling:

### How to Manually Trigger

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **"The Unveiling - Auto Decrypt on Jan 1, 2035"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Check the **"Force unveiling"** checkbox
5. Click **"Run workflow"** button

The workflow will run immediately and perform the same automated unveiling process.

---

## ✅ Testing the Automation

### Test Sealing (Before Launch)

```bash
# Create a test PR with a dummy message
# GitHub Action should automatically:
# 1. Encrypt the file
# 2. Commit to sealed/
# 3. Close the PR
```

### Test Unveiling (Before 2035)

**DO NOT test with real data!**

For testing, you can:
1. Create a separate test repository
2. Use a different date in the cron schedule
3. Use the manual trigger with a test key
4. Verify all steps complete successfully

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Sealing Status

- View **Actions** tab for recent workflow runs
- Check **sealed/** directory for new `.gpg` files
- Monitor closed PRs for confirmation comments

### Check Unveiling Status (2035)

- **Actions** tab will show the unveiling workflow run
- Check **decrypted-messages/** directory for files
- Look for **GitHub Release** created
- Check for **announcement issue** posted
- Verify README was updated

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Why Store Private Key in Secrets?

**Q:** Isn't storing the private key in GitHub Secrets risky?

**A:** Yes and no:
- ✅ **Encrypted at rest** by GitHub
- ✅ **Only accessible** to workflow runs
- ✅ **Not visible** in logs or to unauthorized users
- ✅ **Automatic unveiling** requires it to be accessible
- ⚠️ **Trust in GitHub** is required

### Alternative: Secret Sharing

For maximum security, consider:
1. Split the private key using **Shamir's Secret Sharing**
2. Store shares with multiple trusted maintainers
3. On Jan 1, 2035, manually combine and publish

This provides extra security but requires **manual intervention**.

- ✅ **Multiple maintainers** (no coordination needed)

---

## 🔧 Maintenance Requirements

### During Sealing Period (2025-2034)
- ❌ **No maintenance required**
- ✅ GitHub Actions run automatically
- ✅ No human intervention needed

### At Unveiling (2035)
- ❌ **No maintenance required**

2. **Cryptographic time-locking** using GPG
3. **Distributed trust** (anyone can verify)
4. **Creative GitHub Actions usage** (scheduled future events)
5. **Zero-maintenance operation** (set and forget)
