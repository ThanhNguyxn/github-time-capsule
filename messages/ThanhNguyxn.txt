# 🚀 Final Test - Message to 2035

Hello from October 17, 2025!

This is the FINAL TEST to verify the GitHub Time Capsule automation works perfectly after cleanup.

## What I'm testing:
✅ GPG encryption with public key
✅ Automated workflow execution  
✅ File commit to sealed/ folder
✅ PR auto-close functionality

## If you're reading this in 2035:
🎉 **CONGRATULATIONS!**
- The automation worked flawlessly
- This message was sealed for 10 years
- Technology preserved our words across time

**From 2025 with excitement,**
