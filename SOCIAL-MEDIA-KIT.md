🕰️ GitHub Time Capsule - A Reflection on Technology & Time

I'm excited to share a unique project that combines automation, security, and meaningful reflection.

What it does:
• Allows anyone to write a message to their future self
• Automatically locks it using GitHub Actions
• Unlocks on January 1, 2035 for everyone to read

Why it matters:
✅ Demonstrates 100% automation with GitHub Actions
✅ Shows practical use of OAuth, Next.js, and serverless functions
✅ Creates a global digital time capsule

Technical Stack:
• Next.js 15 + TypeScript
• NextAuth.js for GitHub OAuth
• GitHub Actions for automation
• Vercel for deployment
• AES-256-GCM encryption

Try it: https://github-time-capsule.vercel.app

🕰️ I just discovered the coolest project - GitHub Time Capsule!

Here's the idea:
You write a message today about your life, dreams, predictions for the future, or anything you want. GitHub automatically locks it using encryption. Then on January 1, 2035, your message (and thousands of others) automatically unlocks for everyone to read!

It's like sending a letter to your future self, but powered by technology 🚀

The best part? You don't need to know coding! Just:
1. Visit the website
2. Sign in with GitHub (free)
3. Write your message
4. Click submit

That's it! Your message is sealed for 10 years.

I'm going to write about:
• What my life is like in 2025
• My hopes and dreams
• Predictions for technology in 2035
• A message to future me

What would YOU write? 💭

Title: I built a GitHub Time Capsule - Messages auto-lock today, auto-unlock in 2035

I created a project where anyone can write a message that gets automatically locked using GitHub Actions and will unlock on January 1, 2035.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- NextAuth.js for GitHub OAuth
- GitHub Actions for automation (seal & unseal)
- AES-256-GCM encryption + RSA-4096
- Octokit for GitHub API integration
- Vercel deployment

**Features:**
- 100% automation (fork, PR, encrypt, seal)
- Beautiful web interface for non-technical users
- Rate limiting & security headers
- File ownership verification (messages/username.txt)
- Countdown timer to 2035

**How it works:**
1. User writes message via web or PR
2. GitHub Action validates filename matches username
3. Encrypts message with AES-256-GCM
4. Seals in `sealed/` folder
5. On Jan 1, 2035, scheduled Action decrypts all messages

Try it: https://github-time-capsule.vercel.app
GitHub: https://github.com/ThanhNguyxn/github-time-capsule

Would love feedback on the automation workflow!

Title: Built a Next.js app for a GitHub Time Capsule with OAuth and full automation

Just launched a web interface for a time capsule project! Users can write messages that lock until 2035.

**Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TailwindCSS v4
**Auth:** NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth
**API:** GitHub REST API (Octokit) for auto-fork and PR creation
**Deployment:** Vercel
**Backend:** GitHub Actions for encryption/decryption

The interesting challenge was automating the entire GitHub workflow:
- Auto-fork repository
- Create branch
- Add file
- Submit PR
- All from a web interface!

Subject: Write a message to yourself in 2035 🕰️

Hey!

I wanted to share something cool I found - the GitHub Time Capsule.

It's exactly what it sounds like: you write a message today, and it gets automatically locked until January 1, 2035. On that date, your message (along with thousands of others) will unlock for everyone to read.

You can write about:
• What your life is like right now
• Your hopes and dreams for the next decade
• Predictions for technology and the world
• A personal message to your future self
• Literally anything!

The best part? It takes 2 minutes and requires zero technical knowledge.

Just visit: https://github-time-capsule.vercel.app

Write today. Read in 2035. 🚀

See you in the future!

P.S. The whole thing is open source and uses GitHub Actions for automation - pretty cool tech if you're into that stuff: https://github.com/ThanhNguyxn/github-time-capsule
