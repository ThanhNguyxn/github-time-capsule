### Step 4: Format Guidelines

**File Format:**

- No special formatting required (though you can use Markdown if you wish)

**Example Message Structure:**

```

### Step 5: Submit Your Pull Request

1. **Commit** your message file to your fork
2. Navigate back to the **original repository**
3. Click **Pull Request**
4. Click **New Pull Request**
5. Select your fork's branch
6. Add a title: `Time Capsule Message from @yourusername`
7. Optionally add a description (this won't be sealed, just meta-info about your PR)
8. Click **Create Pull Request**

### Step 6: Automatic Sealing

Once you submit your PR:

1. 🤖 **GitHub Actions will activate** within seconds
2. 🔍 **Your message will be validated** (exists, not empty, under 1MB)
3. 🔐 **Encryption happens** using GPG with a public key
4. 📦 **Sealed file is committed** to `sealed/<username>.txt.gpg` on the main branch
5. 💬 **You'll receive a comment** confirming the sealing
6. 🚪 **PR is automatically closed** (not merged, to keep your original message private)

**Your original message will NOT be in the main repository** — only the encrypted version will be stored.

## 🔄 Updating Your Message

**Can I update my message after submitting?**

Your **first sealed message** is permanent. This preserves the authenticity and timestamp of your original thoughts. 

If you want to update before sealing:
1. Close your original PR before it's processed
2. Delete the file in your fork
3. Create a new file with your updated message
4. Submit a new PR

Once sealed, your message is frozen in time.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### My PR wasn't sealed. What happened?

Check the GitHub Actions logs on your PR for error messages. Common issues:

1. **Wrong filename:** Must be `messages/<exact-username>.txt`
2. **Empty file:** Your message can't be blank
3. **File too large:** Keep it under 1 MB
4. **Wrong directory:** File must be in the `messages/` directory

### I made a typo in my message!

If your PR hasn't been sealed yet:
1. Edit the file in your fork
2. Push the update
3. The PR will be updated automatically

If already sealed, your message is preserved as-is (typos and all—it's authentic!)

### Can I contribute anonymously?

Your GitHub username will be associated with your contribution. If you want more anonymity:
- Create a separate GitHub account
- Don't include identifying information in your message
- Sign your message however you wish (or not at all)
