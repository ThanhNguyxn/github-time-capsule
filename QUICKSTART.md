## ❓ Troubleshooting

### My PR wasn't processed

Check these common issues:
- ❌ Wrong filename (must be `messages/<exact-username>.txt`)
- ❌ File is empty
- ❌ File is too large (>1MB)
- ❌ Wrong directory (must be in `messages/`)

### I want to update my message

If your PR hasn't been sealed yet:
1. Edit the file in your fork
2. Push the changes
3. PR updates automatically

If already sealed:
- Your first message is permanent (authenticity!)
- This preserves the original timestamp

### I have more questions

- Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Check [FAQ section in README](README.md)
- Open a [Discussion](../../discussions)
- Ask in [Issues](../../issues) if it's a bug
